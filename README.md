## Hacker Story
You are hacking away on your laptop, listening to music, you are smashing it, if only you could share this experience...
You spin up a terminal... 
```
$ npm install hackify -g
$ cd /Users/awesomeguy/cool_project
$ hackify
```
BAM! you have hosted a room, a collaborative coding space... No setup, No logins, Your code, on Your machine.
You send the room link to your code bro's.... http://hackify.org?room=123456
They all hit the link... BAM! your all coding together
You chat, you code, you listen to the same music, your coding awesomeness is now a shared experience.
